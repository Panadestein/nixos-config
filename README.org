* NixOS configuration

Welcome to my [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] configuration using [[https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/][home-manager]]. This minimalist config should generate a
production-ready system (at least for my taste) with the [[https://xmonad.org/][xmonad]] tiling window manager and related goodies.
Some parts are tailored to my AMD hardware and need to be adjusted depending on the current machine.
